# Supa Speedy Drifty Bang Bang Cars
Battle cars game built with Unity. One week challenge.


## Branch Convention
Please follow the following conventions:

* When working on a significant piece of work, always use a development branch.
* Small, well tested fixes may be commited directly to "master"
* Typically use a branch for each issue you are working on.
    * This makes tracking issues easier and stops unpredicted changes breaking your workflow.

If you would like changes to be reviewed, please submit a pull request and move on to another task - time is limited.
If you are blocked and don't see any appropriate tasks to take on, please let everyone know in the slack channel - https://bosufulboyfriend.slack.com/

### Master
"master" should always be stable.

Please avoid working directly on master with the exception of small fixes that have been throughly tested locally.

### Training
"training" is an experimental branch for learning the ropes in few days leading up to the start of our challenge period.

It is intended that whatever we get working stably will be merged into master for the start of the challenge.


## Issues
When working on a significant piece of work that has not been assigned to you, please open a new issue for it.
This helps us to know who is working on what and creates a central place to get information with regards to fixes etc.

When opening an issue, be sure to tag it appropriately and where possible assign it to the most qualified member of the team. 
E.g. complex modeling/animation work will likely be assigned to Matt.
